            The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a successor to VAT used in India
            on the supply of goods and service. Both VAT and GST have the same
            taxation slabs. It is a comprehensive, multistage, destination-based
            tax: comprehensive because it has subsumed almost all the indirect
            taxes except a few state taxes.

            A samosa ( Persian: سمبوسه) from the Persian word sambosag (سنبوسگ)
            (meaning 'triangular pastry') is a fried South Asian and West Asian
            snack. It is a pastry with a savory filling, mostly vegetables,
            spiced potatoes, onions, and peas, but also meat or fish. It is made
            in different shapes, including triangular, cone, or crescent,
            depending on the region. Samosas are often accompanied by chutney,
            and have origins in medieval times or earlier. Sweet versions are
            also made. Samosas are a popular appetizer, or snack in the cuisines
            of India, Central Asia, Portugal, East Africa and their South Asian
            diasporas.
